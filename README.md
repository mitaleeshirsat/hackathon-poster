## My Approach

Broke down the design into key components: the "30", text blocks, and decorative shapes. Used Tailwind's responsive utilities to scale everything from mobile to desktop. 

The main challenge was getting the text to look good. Lots of fine-tuning font sizes and letter spacing to keep everything aligned on one line across different screen sizes. Decorative shapes are positioned absolutely and hidden on mobile to keep things clean. 

Added a shadow container with generous padding to give the whole thing a cleaner look.
